# Each test has a comment identifying the bug it guards against.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bug: ftest_orfs ignored the psite-based ORF filter
#
# The original code was:
#   orfs <- intersect(unique(psites$orf), names(anno$trspacecds))  # line 80
#   orfs <- anno$trspacecds[]     # line 81 - BUG: [] overwrites with ALL ORFs
#
# Fixed to:
#   orfs <- anno$trspacecds[orfs]
#
# Consequence of the bug: mapToTranscripts was called with every ORF in the
# annotation regardless of whether any psite belonged to it. The downstream
# filter (psitecov[sum(psitecov > 0) > 1]) still dropped uncovered ORFs, so
# outputs were correct, but the function was O(all ORFs) instead of O(covered
# ORFs). More critically, line 105
#   orflens <- width(orfs[spec_test_df$orf_id])
# relies on spec_test_df$orf_id being valid keys into `orfs`. With the bug
# present, `orfs` happened to be the full trspacecds so any orf_id would be
# found; after the fix, only orf_ids that came from psites are in `orfs`, so
# spec_test_df can never contain an orf_id that is absent from `orfs`.
#
# Regression: verify that (a) ORFs absent from psites get NA results, and
# (b) every non-NA result corresponds to an ORF that was actually in psites.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bug: get_psite_gr silently dropped reads overlapping multiple ORFs
#
# Reads overlapping >1 ORF were correctly assigned a phase/p_offset per ORF
# and one candidate was chosen randomly, but then p_offset was set to NULL
# before being put back into rpfs. The downstream subset(!is.na(p_offset))
# then dropped them entirely, losing valid P-site evidence.
#
# Fixed by removing the `uniq_mov_rpfs$p_offset <- NULL` line.
#
# Regression: psite count should be >= single-ORF-only psite count,
# i.e. multi-ORF reads now contribute rather than being silently dropped.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # After the fix, psites should account for (almost) all covered RPFs.
  # Before the fix, multi-ORF RPFs were silently dropped, so psites would
  # be strictly fewer. We allow for reads dropped by other filters
  # (out-of-bounds, no matching offset) but require no catastrophic loss.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bug: get_psite_gr used merge() to look up phaseshift values, which reorders
# rows by the join keys (phase, readlen). The resulting shft vector was no
# longer aligned with `psites`, so every P-site received a shift meant for
# some other P-site. Under this bug, the final frame distribution of psites
# became essentially a random draw from the global shft distribution,
# independent of the read's own phase. This made ftest_orfs call ~77% of
# ORFs "periodic" on pure random-read null data.
#
# Fixed by using an order-preserving dplyr::left_join.
#
# Regression: for each P-site, assert that the total shift applied equals
# the expected (p_offset - phase + shft). After the fix this must hold for
# every row; before the fix it held only for reads whose merge-destination
# row happened to coincide with their original row.

# Bug: ftest_orfs + ftestvect had a dead return() in ftestvect so the

# the F-test p-value. This meant periodicity_filter_uORFs(..., p.value < 0.05)
# was filtering on spectral power, keeping non-periodic uORFs.
#
# Fixed by removing the early `return()` and computing the actual p-value
# via pf(Fstat, df1 = 2, df2 = 2k - 2, lower.tail = FALSE).
#
# Regression: p.value column must contain values in [0, 1] (probabilities),
# and the columns must include Fstat, spec_coef, p.value.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bug: the periodicity pipeline (get_psite_gr + ftest_orfs) was badly
# mis-calibrated due to the combination of the merge-reorder bug and
# recomputing `shiftdf` on every call to get_psite_gr. On pure random-read
# null data it called ~77% of ORFs "periodic" at p<0.05 (expected 5%).
#
# Fixes:
#   1. merge() -> left_join() (preserve row order)
#   2. calibrate shiftdf on annotated-CDS psites only, not the full set
#   3. remove dead return() in ftestvect so real p-values come out
#
# Regression: under a null where RPF 5' positions are randomized uniformly
# within their host transcripts, ftest_orfs should give approximately
# uniform p-values: median ~0.5 and no more than ~10% of tested ORFs at
# p<0.05 (lenient bound; the true expectation is 5%).
